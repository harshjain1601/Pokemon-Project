            <h3>GARY</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Gary Oak is Ash's first rival. He is based on the character Blue from the Pokémon video game series. Like his counterpart Blue, Gary hails from Pallet Town and is the grandson of renowned Pokémon researcher Professor Oak. Like Ash, Gary collects Gym badges and competes in Pokémon League tournaments in Kanto and Johto. At first, Gary is arrogant, always traveling with cheerleaders who called out his name and constantly teases Ash's group whenever they meet. After losing to a more powerful opponent in the Indigo League, Gary dispenses with the cheerleaders and then becomes more open-minded. At the end of season 2 (Orange Islands), Ash and Gary have their first Pokémon battle in which Gary's Eevee beats Ash's Pikachu. When the battle is over, Gary starts on a new journey to Johto and this subsequently influences Ash to follow him there. After losing to Ash in the Johto League, Gary decides to pursue a career in Pokémon research, impeding his rivalry with Ash. Until his loss to Ash, Gary had always thought of Ash as a poor trainer but he eventually comes to accept him as his equal.
